# Weekly-Project-1
This project analyzes and visualizes the strengths and weaknesses of Analytics students in their programming knowledge, based on the undergraduate programs they completed.

PART 1:

The dataset is a survey collected from students enrolled in ALY 6010. It includes information
on students' undergraduate programs of study and their proficiency levels in software tools
such as Python, Excel, and R for data analysis.

I imported the CSV file into R and reviewed the
dataset to understand the data types, number of
rows, and columns. The dataset consists of 14
rows and 16 columns.

After examining the dataset, I realized
the need to restructure its columns and
rows. I then created a new dataframe
containing the most relevant
information.

Part 2: Discriptive Statistics

After restructuring the dataset, I added 5 new columns with 14 rows each and performed
descriptive statistics on the 3 major skillsets in the dataset. The results show that the mean skill
level for Excel is 2.78, the highest among the three, followed by R at 2.29, and Python at 1.50.
This suggests that most students have limited skills or knowledge in the Python programming
language.

I then performed descriptive statistics for the various majors. The data is grouped into four main categories based on students' undergraduate majors: Major 1 represents Biology/Science, Major 2 represents Business, Major 3 represents Humanities, and Major 4 represents STEM. From the analysis, it appears that students with a STEM background have a higher mean skill level across all three software tools compared to those from non-STEM majors, indicating greater proficiency and knowledge.

After performing a more simplified discriptive statistics
of the data, Excel had the highest mean with a high standard deviation.

PART 3
Finally, I performed some visualizations on the dataset to observe the relationships between the various skillsets.The visualizations contains scatter plots, jitter plots, and boxplots of the various skillsets.
